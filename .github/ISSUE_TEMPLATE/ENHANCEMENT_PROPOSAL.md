## Summary

[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Guide-level explanation

[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already approved and implemented. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.

## Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the enhancement proposal. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

A very important thing to list here is ideas that were discarded in the process, as these tend to crop up again after a while. Describing them here saves time as it allows people discussing those ideas again in the future to refer to this proposal.

## Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the proposal process before this gets merged?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this proposal that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this proposal?

## Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the proposal you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future proposal; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent proposal. The section merely provides additional information.
